<h1>Hello Shakeel</h1> <br /> If you are using Azure SDK for PHP to access Azure Storage Service, we highly recommend you to migrate to this SDK for faster issue resolution and quicker feature implementation. We are working on supporting the latest service features as well as improvement on existing APIs. <br /><br />

For now, Microsoft Azure Storage PHP client libraries share almost the same interface as the storage blobs, tables, queues and files APIs in Azure SDK for PHP. However, there are some minor breaking changes need to be addressed during your migration. You can find the details in BreakingChanges.md.<br />
